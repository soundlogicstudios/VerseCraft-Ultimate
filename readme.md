# versecraft (full skeleton)

This is the **full planning skeleton**: isolated screens + core manager + docs + skin asset tree.

## run
Serve as a static site and open `index.html`.

## wired flow (placeholder)
splash → terms-of-service → main-menu → library → settings → credits → debug → splash

## naming
Lowercase kebab-case only. No underscores in ids/paths.
